# Task 17: Process Limit Adjustment

## Question

In the `Stratos Datacenter`, our `Storage server` is encountering performance degradation due to excessive processes held by the `nfsuser` user. To mitigate this issue, we need to enforce limitations on its maximum processes. Please set the maximum process limits as specified below:

**Task:**  

a. Set the soft limit to `1027`

b. Set the hard limit to `2026`

## Solution

Here's the exact step-by-step solution you'd run on the Nautilus backup server:

1. **Check if firewalld is running**

```bash
sudo systemctl status firewalld
```
If it's not active, start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start firewalld
```

2. **Verify the active zone**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
```
ðŸ‘‰ Normally it should show public as the default zone.
If not, set the default zone to **public**:

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=public
```

3. **Add a permanent rule to allow port 8083/tcp**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=8083/tcp --permanent
```

4. **Reload firewalld to apply changes**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```

5. **Confirm the rule is applied**

```bash
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports
```
You should see:

```bash
8083/tcp
```

âœ… Done â€” now all incoming connections on `8083/tcp` are allowed in the `public` zone.
